Design Choices

I think I'm going to allow for a maximum trip of 6 weeks so that I only ever have to get 2 months worth of data

The front end will eventually allow people to choose their trip length, and the cost, the rest I can sort out.

I’ve gone with a red/yellow/green traffic light system type approach to this problem so far because I think 
that it will be easier to flag great deals by using tiers as opposed to supporting a whole bunch of individual
user’s needs

I think Go could be a solid choice for parallelising my solution, I’ll do a bit more reading into it tomorrow.
